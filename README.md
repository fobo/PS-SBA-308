This is a inventory management website. In it you will find a login page, a register page, and a content page.
The login page checks the username and password for a valid match and will allow the user to login to the content page. The content page is filled with a generated table with products. This uses Javascript to create the table and built in methods serve up content.
The graphical design of the webpage is built with bootstrap and css, and some javascript animations.
There is a navigation bar that will tell the user which page they are currently on.
